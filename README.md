# project_collective_behavior

## Project Description
This project is part of the **Collective Behaviour course at the Faculty of Computer Science.**.  
Our goal is to study and expand upon existing models of **collective animal behaviour**.

We use as a starting point the paper:  
*Predator–prey survival pressure is sufficient to evolve swarming behaviors*  
New Journal of Physics, 25 (2023) 093024  (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/acf33a)

##  Project Plan
### **Milestone 1 — First Report**
In the first phase, we will:  
- Read and summarize the chosen paper and related references.  
- Review concepts and existing models of swarming in predator–prey interactions.  
- Recreate the **baseline swarming model** described in the paper.  
- Run **initial simulations** to verify baseline behaviours (emergence of swarming under predator pressure).  
- Document our intended approach for extending the model later in the course.  
- Write Report 1 (IMRAD structure, 4 pages max) and push both **source + PDF** into the GitHub repository.  


### **Milestone 2 — Second Report**
- Polish the first report based on received comments.  
- Add **details about methods and proposed methodology for verification**.  
- Follow **IMRAD structure**.  
- Page limit: **4 pages**.  
- Explicitly specify **individual contributions** of each team member (who wrote/implemented what).  
- **Deliverables**: Source + PDF of updated report in repository.
- Update README.md 

### **Milestone 3 — Final Report**
- Polished version of previous reports with improvements.  
- Concise **introduction with relevant research** and problem statement.  
- Methods: clear, reproducible description of our model & evaluation.  
- Results: include **comparisons with previous research**.  
- Discussion: interpret results, link with literature, propose future work.  
- Follow **IMRAD structure**.  
- Page limit: **4 pages / 2000 words max**.  
- Must include **individual contributions** again.  
- Attach **slides for presentation** (≤20 min) covering:  
  a) overview of the problem & motivation,  
  b) initial goals & achieved results,  
  c) main challenges & solutions,  
  d) what we would do differently.  
- Finalize GitHub repository with:  
  - A clear **README.md** (one-paragraph project description, main paper, goals, level achieved).  
  - Detailed **instructions to run simulations**.  
- **Deliverables**: Final report (source + PDF) + slides in repository.
- Update README.md
